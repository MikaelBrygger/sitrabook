### **Games Integrate Themselves to Society**

In terms of economic scale, the size of the global market of games is estimated between 200 and 300 billion dollars. Its growth is still expected to continue -- there are estimates for the market surpassing 500 billion inside the next ten years. For comparison, the market size for music industry is under 30 billion.

This is a result from continuous expansion of game culture over the last decades, from a minor presence to significant field of social interaction. The economic numbers hide another form of growth: diversification of forms. Alongside digital games, forms like roleplaying games have been innovated, and the variety of board games has been expanded massively.

Yet, one rarely hears the question: Why? Games have been relatively stable cultural element for at least 6000 years. So why would they grow to such size and variety, in a span of few decades? The easy answer of computerization is insufficient: This growth initiated before personal computers, and continues to expand and diversify, outside of them.

In other words, there is another story. And this story is perhaps more important social opportunity, economies included.

The integration of games into the fabric of society is self-evident. The question we should ask now is: Has society integrated to games?

### **Games, Economies, Organizations**

Games are environments, built by rules. Agreeing to such rules between people institutes the game, and the possibility of its play, to existence.

But this observation applies to organizations and economies as well. Consider the following examples:

* Money does not, strictly speaking, hold value -- it cannot do so by itself. Rather, the rules surrounding money enforce its valuation.
* Walls and buildings do not make organizations -- rather, they are tools an organization uses for its concretization. The organization itself is constituted by the rules of its social contracts.
* Like games, economies and organizations can only exist if people commit to their rules, thus producing their existence. If there's no commitment, this existence remains unrealized... like an unplayed board game, gathering dust upon a shelf.

These shared roots extend even deeper -- and from their connections we can glean possibilities towards future economies and organizations.

* Economy has combined material resources with financial systems of money and other abstracted assets. Games hold resources as well -- things that harbor an effect on the total "economic" system of the game.&#x20;
* Games also contain a vast variety of point systems, serving similar roles to money. Arguably there's more variety among such point systems than in instruments of finance.
* It's also curious how some ideals of our contemporary economy, such as the logic of profit above everything else, are transforming the economy itself into a more game-like system, as profit simplifies the complexity of economy towards a simple win condition.
* In contrast, games have expanded outside win/lose logics, to structures of playable collaborations and other social dynamics. Roleplaying, particularly, has expanded the motivations of play towards the variety exhibited by the social world, at large. While economy seeks to constrain human behavior to a traditional win/lose game, games expand towards a expanded scope of social principles.
* Economic entrepreneurship is largely project driven. In games, we can witness a large variety of similar structures, from scenarios to quests, missions to adventures.
* In terms of the organizational basis of economy, games themselves resemble organizations: Contoured systems of interactions, which distribute rights and rules towards themselves.

One could go on: Risk and reward are major paradigms in both. Emphasis on measures is equally present in economies and games. And all of these fields seek to systemize towards what is valuable and what is not: valuable in an economy, within an organization, inside a game...

#### **A Language for Expressing Societal Innovation**

Perhaps the increasing cultural orientation towards games traces a collective intuition of possibilities that could be expressed thusly: **Games offer a potential "language" for expressing societal innovation.** They correspond with the social systems that mostly enforce our behavior, transforming them into a creative medium. They set similar limits, but always offer a way out: stop playing, or change the rules. Or play something else: their emphasis is on vast variety, rather than the valorization of the "right" system.

It's practically impossible to prove that this balancing factor would be a reason for the unusual growth of games. But whether it would explain the historical anomaly of games, or not, isn't the topic of interest here. Rather, this overlap of games, economies and organizations highlights a distinct potential for expansion -- from expanding our organizational conceptions to economic innovation.

And as we are **moving towards a programmable medium of economic systems, the implementation of the variety that games can offer is turning from a hypothetical idea to a concretizable possibility.**

So, if we would need **a library, a toolkit for the ingredients of future economies, a library that is just opening to general use -- we already have it.** We just have to look at it from an angle to perceive the opening it offers...

### **Playable Snapshots for Future Economies**

Towards the future, here are some snapshots of interactions that already exist in this reservoir of games. They're picked to reflect the potential expansions to economies and organizations, as we now know them, painting a picture of developments that might enter our everyday reality.

#### **Case: Expanding Jobs by Roles**

The traditional description of a job is conceived around a title, such as "graphic designer." These titles are commonly picked from known archetypes, though there's a recent trend where titles are approached more flexibly, supporting novel titling.

Beyond such titles, jobs are often defined by duties, and descriptors of personality expectations. Overall the approaches for expressing a job are rather limited, which is unfortunate, especially given how crucial such definition is for operativity.

**Roles as Playbooks**

Compared to jobs, playbooks, and other similar approaches for expressing roles in games, are more holistical in their approach: the expression of a role should operate like a general guidebook, combining different styles to accommodate for a variety of situations. They can combine rules, rights, descriptions, relation systems, resource maps etc.

Playbooks are also **living definitions** -- that is, there can be parts in them that never change, parts that are altered situationally, personal or collective additions, etc. This enables structuring of a role in a more expressive manner. It's not meant to remove the personal meaning a role generates, but enhances its interactions with others.

**Gaining a Role, Holding a Role**

There's a lot of variety to how roles are distributed, corresponding to different intentions of design. Here are a few examples:

* Roles on a rack: Roles are available in a "place" --there can be a particular selection in such a place, creating an operative palette for that place. For example, a place of presentation might have two presenter roles, an infinite number of spectator roles, and one optional diagrammist that comes with tools.
* Roles as tokens: Roles can be transacted by whomever hold the tokens that come with their rights. Who holds the tokens, and how many they have is a design space of its own.
* Roles as seats:&#x20;

#### **Case: Playing with Values**

**Multidimensional Values**

This is a highly varied approach that is present in many board games, particularly. As a particularly interesting case, games often use multidimensionality in a many-to-one manner, which has promisingh economic potential.&#x20;

To outline this, even common playing card can suffice: A single card can potentially used as:

* A particular card, say, a Two of Hearts
* A red card
* A suit (one of four)
* A particular number
* Just one card, without any other value

The potential for such structures? Think of this, for example: An organization that offers tokens for its members. They have many dimensions, some might entail possibilities of governance, even particular governance, some might give access to resources etc. Each of these can be tailored. But beyond the dimensions one token can be exchanged to monetary payment.

The different dimensions might even be based on changing exchange rates, depending on the status of the organization. Overall, this offers the organization a tailorable palette of inner structures, dynamically. It also creates a constant balancing between payment and power in the organization. And since we commonly understand playing cards, we already understand multidimensional values.

#### **Case: Organizing Economies**

**Game Board Structures as Organizational Diagrams**

The recently popular model of Doughnut Economics could be considered as an example of this approach, as its main model functions like a game board. As board games have an inherent necessity to design ever-new architectures around social interaction (as each designer aims for a unique design) we're left with a historical library of frameworks of interaction.

#### **Case: Play to Decide**

Voting is a mini-game already -- its design language is indistinguishable from games. Unsurprisingly, games provide a large repertoire of variations based on it, and on decision models in general. To underline a few opportune ones:

* Polyphonic decisions: In essence, different decide different perspectives of the same decision. For example, someone might have the final exprssion on what are we deciding upon, and what are our options; someone else chooses among the options; a third one decides the actions based on the options decided.
* Decision matrices: One simple example of such is called the Palette mechanic. For a complex issue, each participant can add a "yes" topic (a thing to emphasize) or a "no" topic (a thing to exclude). The end result is a parametric definition of the topic. The interaction is quite simple, yet the model works well for many thorny decisions, contouring the decision, rather than oversimplifying it.

#### **Case: Fail Forward**

The innovations in games towards failures (on a particular attempt, a large project, etc.) and states of disagreement have interesting implications, when considered in the context of the larger society. These stem from the design attitude where all potential social situations are design challenges: How can they be made fertile for the process as a whole?

An example of such is the paradigm of Fail Forward itself, which can be summarized as a perspective: Failure is a generative state -- its key question: How has the failure progressed the situation?

In practice, the point of recognizing a failure is transformed into a generative question, essentially asking, what was produced by the failure? Once there's an answer to the posed question, such as recognition of something that was missing from the process, the failure gets framed as positive production: For example: A task of creating a new description of the process itself.

From a wider perspective, the most important element here is the change in mindset: Everything progresses something, and it's smarter (in the long-term) to frame attention towards forms of progress, even if they're not along the path initially desired.

#### **Cases in Sum**

All of these cases offer peeks on a world that already exists, being tried and tested in the many, many little laboratories of games. Increasingly they're a reality for many -- at least a partial reality of their social lives that they rely uponn, or are even enthusiastic about.

This is organization of a certain reality. And certainly, this part of reality is growing. The question is: Do we allocate for its arrival, or will we be surprised as its imposed upon us?

### **Proposal: Play an Organization to Play an Economy**

Every organization, whether corporation, association or a DAO, forms its own micro-economy: It designates its own resource allocation, and the rights that guide that guide that allocation. Certainly, most traditional organizations follow a common formula for this -- regardless, this micro-economy  is theirs to set, and they could distribute it in a variety of forms.

This highlights an opening for the development of new, game-based economics. If we approach this micro-economic aspect of organization as a developmental opportunity, they can function like testing laboratories. If they fail, this failure is limited to the organization; if they succeed, their developments can become the basis of other organizations.

This sets a framework for playtesting new economies, even in interaction with the economy as a whole.&#x20;
