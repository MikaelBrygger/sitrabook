# Mitä jos organisaatiot olisivat ohjelmoitavia?



## Organization and Economy

To reveal cards we're playing with, here are four notions -- concerning economy, organization, governance and their programmability -- that underlie this scenario as a whole.

The notions insist on inseparability of these fields, pointing out the threads that connec them. They also reflect the learnings from our years of studying programmable economies.&#x20;

1. _Any economy is organized to existence_, requiring socially accepted rules that enable it to operate within society. These rules are not necessarily accepted by everyone, certainly -- but this is true for any organizational rules. Thus, whenever we're creating new economies, programmable or otherwise, we're inevitably proposing social organization.
2. This entails that _there's no economy without its own, particular governance_. The governance might be partially based on the rules set by programming -- but ultimately someone has the rights to run, modify or remove the code, which effectively functions as organizational governance.
3. While an economy might operate through a digital platform, _whatever occurs on that platform must interact with the larger, organized world around it_ to become economically impactful.
4. Therefore, _any form of economy is a social architecture_, founded upon its _organizational design_.

## Shifting from Paper to Programming

Our organizational forms has been conceived in the imaginary of paper: Whether corporation, association or co-operative… all these structures limit their operations to the capabilities of paper documents. Because of this, the networked architectures of co-operation are currently extensions beyond our organizations proper, and therefore generally outside of any legal backing, besides contracts and licenses.

Thus, legally speaking, Finland does not offer citizens a possibility to establish a network as an official organization. But, if it wanted an advantage within an increasingly networked world, it could...

In a nutshell, programmability offers a reconsideration of the operative palette of society. It offers us the question: What becomes possible if we _reconsider organization from the ground up_, from the _perspective of programmable frameworks for social structures_?

To shed light on this potential, here are two cases, mapping this question upon two very different fields, both exploring this change in our organizational expression.

## Case: Social Media

### Social Media as a Form of Organization

The phenomenon that we commonly call "social media" is, at its core, a new field of programmable organization. The current platforms have merely scratched the surface of the possibilities in this field.

The operations of social media are thoroughly organizational: Such platforms set rules for people to operate, afford them rights within their organization, and coordinate their possibilities of relation -- all of these are issues elementary to organizational structures.

### Societal Interests of Social Media

The interests of social media, and the companies behind them, are not the interests of society at large. When an organization is solely a function of profit, but not profit for its users, the essential role of its users is to generate profit.

If we consider the points from the beginning of the text, relating to organization and economy, it's reasonable to observe these platforms, and their owners, as governing the people upon the platform. With such considerations, the tendencies towards social friction upon various platforms of social media are rather unsurprising.

### Organizational Potential of Social Media

From a wider perspective, we can observe significant societal potential for the field that social media operates upon. Using programmatic means to organize ourselves is not the main source of problems with social media. It's rather how those means are currently being used.

But what if we turned this situation on its head -- what if we enabled such organizational forms as societal architectures? This could open possibilities such as:

* Use an accepted template to create an open source social platform as an organizational basis for your collective, just as you can now form an association or corporation.
* Founding that platform organization can be automated, up and running in the matter of minutes.
* Offer automated bookkeeping and tax reporting for the organization's economic activity, both internally or externally.

Economic automation is an opportune example of something that is relatively easy to implement in programmable organization.

Such implementations have been developed in DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) that have become prevalent on blockchain architectures. But this is not an opportunity that is necessarily shackled to blockchains -- many of the organizational functions of DAOs are open source, and are not necessarily dependent on blockchain architectures.

## Case: DAOs

### DAOs as Tillers of New Fields

DAOs form another fledgling field of programmable organizations. Like social architectures of social media, DAOs also offer opportunities beyond their current usage.

The organizational imaginary is arguably rather limited, much narrower than the palette of traditional organization. The reason for this narrowness is not capability, but possibly a lack of in-depth organizational culture: They've been developed mostly as extensions of tokens, and have thus focused on variants of equity models, where the flexibility of crypto is used to tailor value distributions of the tokens.

Likewise, governance of its members has been considered in a limited scope of interactions, mainly voting by equity, where tokens determine the weight of the vote, and variations thereof. From wider spectrum of organizations, this is a rather limited palette, compared to the range of interactions and functions we can observe in organizations on a societal level.

However, this range is not a reflection of limitations of capability. Similarly to social media architectures, DAOs highlight the flexibility of programmable medium for social organization, capable of not only reproducing, but also expanding our capability to organize, in all areas.

_It would be highly beneficial to utilize the automated functionality, already implemented in DAOs as a starting point to build towards wider palette of organizational sociality._

### Legal and Societal Empowerment

DAOs are not legally recognized as organizations, and their members don't hold the legal affordances provided by traditional organizations. Legal recognition of selected, limited forms of programmable organizations would be a considerable opportunity for expanding our social architecture, both organizationally and economically.

_However, this should not simply be approached as an argument for validating DAOs, in their current forms._

Rather, their operative capabilities should be considered as a source towards a discourse into how society operates, and _how it desires to operate_. They're concrete explorations of this topic, and as such, open theoretical and practical considerations of future forms of organization.

As we're _increasingly operating upon a networked reality_, proactively _harnessing the capabilities of this reality as sources of societal expansion_ presents an advantageous pathway for development: It could significantly increase our organizational and economic expressivity, both on the level of society, and affordances of its citizens.

There would be obvious benefits from such development: For example, the automated bookkeeping and tax reporting, mentioned above, make such organizations _economically lighter to operate_, enabling citizens to organize themselves with less overhead costs and automated administrative labor.

At the same time, the society receives a benefit of _curtailing the grey market_, and can operate on _real-time information of economic activity._

## Operative Proposal: "Organizational Linux" for Finland

From its early development, one of the motivations of Linux was the enablement of its users. PCs had become both cheap and powerful enough to operate the same network software that supported the early internet. Through using Linux these affordances would be available to any PC, extending its capabilities considerably.

Such an idea of social empowerment would be opportune for a nation state that is transforming itself to our increasingly networked reality, alongside the rest of the world. The nation state, particularly its structures for collective organization, is surprisingly similar to an operating system, from the perspective of its citizens.

Therefore, a development resembling early Linux, but for upgrading our structures of organization, could achieve similar effect, but arguably to a much wider societal impact.

### Potential Outcomes

Such a development would provide organizational structures inherently compatible with each other, being able to interact not just externally, but down to their internal structures. The standardization would enable automated network operations between many organizations, whenever desired. Standardization in programming does not necessarily remove flexibility — sometimes even increasing it. After all, internet is built upon such standards -- they're the main source of its operational capacity.

At the same time, the developed forms of programmable organization would form a reservoir of public goods. Their development could respond to needs of the citizens, not to the profits of corporations (which are unlikely to remain in Finland, in most cases).

Such organizations, both lightweight with automated accounting and reporting, and capable of forming clusters of network operations on a case-by-case basis, would be significantly more capable than traditional organizations. For a start, large scale co-operation can provide significant economic benefits. But this would not only be an economic expansion, but also social one, given that the choice of social interactions would be given back to the people themselves.

To say that this would provide an advantage for Finland could potentially be an understatement...

### Core Principles of "Organizational Linux"

**Agenda:**

* Implementation of capabilities of programmable organization on a societal level.

**Open source:**

* Transparency of function.
* Wider inspection of functionality: robust and reliable operations.

**Standardized, interoperative:**

* Standards enable organizations to integrate their economics and governance.
* Enabling of network operations across multiple organizations.
* Automated co-operation available to both large and small organizations.

**Public development:**

* Discourse on future functionality, extensions.
* Reflecting shared organizational and economic needs and desires.
