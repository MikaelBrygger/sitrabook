# Prologue

**Summary**

We live with two apparent economic imperatives: that economic growth is the key to improved living standards, and that no one likes how growth is measured. So we stumble on trying to balance these two incompatible dimensions.

This isn’t a new insight. The critiques of increases in GDP as the base metric of real growth in living standards have been prevalent for more than 40 years, focussed especially on gender biases and neglect of environmental damage. There have followed attempts of data reform including the development of more gender-neutral categories, and pricing environmental costs and benefits not accounted for in markets (externalities) to make them more consistent with GDP conventions. There have also been attempts to develop national wellbeing measures, in recognition that GDP data do not incorporate subjective life experiences of the economy. These national wellbeing data are being used for inter-national rankings (in which Finland is consistently very high) yet these data do not feed formally into evaluations of economic growth.&#x20;

Wellbeing data, while limited, signal an issue of growing importance: that how we define and measure what is ‘valuable’ is not adequately addressed in current economic analytics or strategy. A focus on value and how we could measure and nurture it, is currently manifesting on the negative side: that people’s experience of the economy is increasingly precarious.&#x20;

For individuals, there is widespread awareness that the broad agenda of economic growth is having negative effects expressed as growing inequality, environment degradation, insecure employment and less certainty about social safety nets. The era of ‘neo-liberalism’, which was touted as the agenda for growth following the end of the mid 20th century long boom, has quickly petered out, leaving people more insecure, seeing no real collective strategies to build security.&#x20;

For governments, there is uncertainty of policy direction, as global integration has promised growth through international trade and investment, but with dubious and patchy benefits. There is a stark need to rethink how we measure and perform the economy.&#x20;

The tools for this re-think are not widely discussed, and certainly not in international economic agencies, national treasuries and central banks. National policy makers appear to have their hands tied behind their backs, due to conservative approaches of international regulatory constraints. With the rise of ‘free trade’ and competitive international finance’, governments increasingly have their policy agendas constrained. The WTO has come to increasingly call out domestic subsidies to industry(direct and indirect) as breaches of international agreements. This seems to be a policy direction that is serving the world’s largest economies where the location of reserves of capital is tending to dictate the frontiers of technologial innovtion. Yet along with that broad, longer-term momentum, the US administration’s recent use of tariffs as a short run tool of international policy, while at odds with the WTO, is adding a new level of instability and uncertainty. Indeed, the direction of US macro policy, especially internationally-focussed issues of the US debt to GDP ratio, managing global demand for US Treasury Bonds, and longer-term goals to manage the value of the US dollar, are all creating uncertainty, both in strategic design and potential outcomes of any such policies.

Technology, too, is exerting profound and unpredictable economic and social effects both internationally and domestically, including on employment, but it isn’t showing in economic data. As Nobel Prize economist Robert Solow quipped in 1987: “you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics”. The same may well be happening with the advent of AI. Around the advanced industrialised countries, productivity is measured as low; not justifying wage increases. This low (measured) productivity/low wage experience has been amplified by the inflation that followed nation-states’ Covid stimulus packages, where resulting excess demand was framed as warranting interest rate rises to enforce household expenditure reductions.&#x20;

AI therefore enters the mainstream in an era of low wages so that yields of AI are likely to go to the owners of capital; not to workers, and a scenario of growing unemployment, especially middle-class unemployment, could well shift the long-term distribution of income between labor and capital: a distribution that is a general proxy for long-term stability. In current circumstances, nation states would have limited policy tools, and limited international capacity, to amend such a long-term trend.&#x20;

This scenario of international uncertainty, national volatility, growing household financial precarity and social anxiety provides the setting for re-thinking policies for economic growth. It requires a reframing of conventional approaches to growth and distribution that goes beyond (but includes) issues of gender bias and environmental sustainability and extends in directions that are not yet seen as immediate policy alternatives.

In opening a policy reframe, the two key themes of this report are:&#x20;

* measuring the economy differently&#x20;

What are new ways of counting (and verifying) what is perceived to be valuable in the economy; what are the technologies that will enable this counting

* new forms of ‘economic’ institutions.

How can states nurture economies differently, by both directly supporting desired economic activities in new ways (for example, that do not transgress WTO guidelines) and facilitating the growth of institutional forms that do economy ‘differenty’.

In essence, measuring differently involves the elevation of ways of compiling data that are premised on the widespread experience of volatility, uncertainty and precarity. Different forms of economic institutions build also on the measurement issue. While neither the measurement agenda nor the institutional agenda should be locked in through the depiction of a complete alternative scenario, there are some key developments that drive our proposals.

* &#x20;the economy is becoming increasingly programmable. There has, for about 20 years, been recognition that data generated about economic activity is becoming increasingly detailed and potentially universally accessible. Perhaps national governments are not the custodians of greatest policy insight?
* economic agency (the capacity of individuals and their organizations to compute and to act)  is increasingly shifting to the edges. Perhaps the co-ordination of economic growth strategies need not be a centralised process

If economic programmability might be seen to imply a capacity for coordinated planning, the usual implication, whether it applies to a corporation or a nation, is centralised control. Indeed, it could be centralised, and mid 20th century ‘planned’ economies would be operating very differently with today’s computational capacities. But it need not be centralised; indeed when computational capacity is intrinsically distributed, to centralise it would require an override of its own developmental momentum. But it also warrants emphasis that being ‘distributed’ need not mean reliance on market forces, at least not as that is understood in its ‘neo-liberal’ meaning. The potential to measure differently  means that economic data, including performance metrics, can be measured by criteria other than those linked to profit,

The economy as a network of distributed information, analysis and action holds incredible potential, including for reframing economic growth.
